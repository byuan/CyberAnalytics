UPDATEThe “perfect” Windows vulnerability known as the Zerologon bug is getting a patch assist from two non-Microsoft sources, as they strive to fill in the gaps that the official fix doesn’t address.They roll out as Microsoft announced that it is tracking active exploitation in the wild. “We have observed attacks where public exploits have been incorporated into attacker playbooks,” the firm tweeted on Wednesday.Both Samba and 0patch have issued fixes for CVE-2020-1472, an privilege-escalation bug which, as previously reported, stems from the Netlogon Remote Protocol, available on Windows domain controllers, which is used for various tasks related to user- and machine-authentication.Exploiting the bug allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to a domain controller to completely compromise all Active Directory identity services, according to Microsoft. A proof-of-concept exploit was just released for the issue, which is a critical flaw rating 10 out of 10 on the CvSS severity scale.“This attack has a huge impact: It basically allows any attacker on the local network (such as a malicious insider or someone who simply plugged in a device to an on-premise network port) to completely compromise the Windows domain,” said researchers with Secura, in a whitepaper published earlier this month.Microsoft did issue a patch for the flaw in August, during its regularly scheduled Patch Tuesday updates. However, not all systems are compatible with the fix, according to Mitja Kolsec, CEO and co-founder at 0patch, which issued a “micropatch” of its own for the bug.“Our micropatch was made for Windows Server 2008 R2, which reached end-of-support this January and stopped receiving Windows updates,” Kolsec told Threatpost. “Many organizations are still using this server and the only way for it to get extended security updates from Microsoft was to move it to Azure (cloud) — which is an unacceptable option for most organizations.”The micropatch is logically identical to Microsoft’s fix, he explained in a recent blog post: “We injected it in function NetrServerAuthenticate3 in roughly the same place where Microsoft added the call to NlIsChallengeCredentialPairVulnerable, but since the latter doesn’t exist in old versions of netlogon.dll,  we had to implement its logic in our patch.”0patch is also porting the micropatch to various still-supported Windows Servers for customers who for various reasons can’t apply the Microsoft patch, he added.Meanwhile, it turns out that Samba, a file-sharing utility for swapping materials between Linux and Windows systems, also relies on the Netlogon protocol, and thus suffers from the vulnerability.The bug exists when Samba is used as domain controller only (most seriously the Active Directory DC, but also the classic/NT4-style DC), it said in an advisory this week. It added, “installations running Samba as a file server only are not directly affected by this flaw, though they may need configuration changes to continue to talk to domain controllers.”The company noted that versions 4.8 and above of Samba are not vulnerable unless they have the smb.conf lines ‘server schannel = no’ or ‘server schannel = auto’. Samba versions 4.7 and below are vulnerable unless they have ‘server schannel = yes’ in the smb.conf.Last Friday, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an emergency directive for federal agencies to patch against the bug. Federal agencies that haven’t patched their Windows Servers against the Zerologon vulnerability by Monday Sept. 21 at 11:59 pm EDT are in violation. And in light of the active, in-the-wild exploitation flagged by Microsoft, patching should be at the top of the to-do list for all organizations.

Google’s new release of Chrome 85.0.4183.121 for Windows, Mac, and Linux fixes 10 security flaws.Google has stomped out several serious code-execution flaws in its Chrome browser. To exploit the flaw, an attacker would merely need to convince a target to visit a specially crafted webpage via phishing or other social-engineering lures.Overall, Google’s release of Chrome 85.0.4183.121 for Windows, Mac and Linux – which will roll out over the coming days – fixed 10 vulnerabilities. The successful exploitation of the most severe of these could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser, according to Google. Google Chrome versions prior to 85.0.4183.121 are affected.“Depending on the privileges associated with the application, an attacker could view, change or delete data,” according to Google’s Tuesday security advisory. “If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights.”Google disclosed five high-severity flaws in its Tuesday advisory, although technical details remain scant as this information is usually “kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix,” according to its advisory.However, Google did say that “these vulnerabilities can be exploited if a user visits, or is redirected to, a specially crafted web page.”The high-severity flaws include an out-of-bounds read error in storage in Google Chrome (CVE-2020-15960). This heap buffer-overflow flaw could allow a remote attacker to potentially perform out of bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.Also fixed were three flaws relating to insufficient policy enforcement. These include two bugs stemming from extensions in Google Chrome  (CVE-2020-15961, CVE-2020-15963), which could allow an attacker who convinced a user to install a malicious extension to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted Chrome Extension.The third sufficient policy-validation (CVE-2020-15962) issue exists in Chrome’s serial function, and could allow a remote attacker to potentially perform out-of-bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.Finally, Google fixed an out-of-bounds write flaw (CVE-2020-15965) in V8, an open-source JavaScript engine developed by The Chromium Project for Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers. The flaw could allow a remote attacker to potentially perform out-of-bounds memory access via a crafted HTML page.Google said that there are currently no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. The company urged Chrome users to apply the stable channel update to vulnerable systems immediately, and reminded users “not to visit un-trusted websites or follow links provided by unknown or un-trusted sources.”Last month, Google fixed various severe vulnerabilities in its web browsers, including a bug in Google’s Chromium-based browsers that could allow attackers to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) on websites, in order to steal data and execute rogue code. Google also fixed a high-severity Chrome vulnerability that could be used to execute arbitrary code, in August.Share this article:A new ‘fork’ of the Cerberus banking trojan, called Alien, targets victims’ credentials from more than 200 mobile apps, including Bank of America and Microsoft Outlook.The official app store is taking on spy- and surveillance-ware, along with apps that could be used to mount political-influence campaigns.

The patches plug holes in a wide range of products and address denial-of-service, file overwrite and input validation attacks. The advisory was planned and part of Cisco’s IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.Twenty-nine of the Cisco bugs are rated high severity, with 13 rated medium in severity. The most noteworthy are a number of vulnerabilities opening the door for remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on targeted systems.Two CVEs, tracked as CVE-2020-3421 and CVE-2020-3480, both are tied to a flaw in Cisco’s Zone-Based Firewall. “Multiple vulnerabilities in the Zone-Based Firewall feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload or stop forwarding traffic through the firewall,” Cisco wrote.
The bulletin also included several other vulnerabilities open to attack by remote unauthenticated users. A web UI authorization bypass vulnerability, according to Cisco, “could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to utilize parts of the web UI for which they are not authorized.” Similarly, a split Domain Name System DoS bug is also vulnerable to a remote unauthenticated attacker.“A vulnerability in the Split DNS feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition,” wrote Cisco. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to resolve an address or hostname that the affected device handles. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.”Bugs open to exploit by local and adjacent authenticated users also peppered the list of CVEs. For example, one flaw tracked as CVE-2020-3417 impacts any Cisco hardware running Cisco IOS XE’s software and allows a authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on targeted hardware. “This vulnerability is due to incorrect validations by boot scripts when specific ROM monitor (ROMMON) variables are set,” according to Cisco.“An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing code to a specific directory in the underlying operating system (OS) and setting a specific ROMMON variable. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying OS. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need access to the root shell on the device or have physical access to the device,” the bulletin added of CVE-2020-3417.Vulnerabilities ripe for DoS attacks dominated Cisco’s list of potential exploits. Specific products included in the security bulletin include various SKUs of its Catalyst Embedded Wireless Controller (CVE-2020-3418), cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers (CVE-2020-3509) and Cisco Aironet Access Point (CVE-2020-3559).Share this article:Multiple flaws in system software that causes errors in packet handling could allow an attacker to consume memory and crash devices.Nine bugs were patched, eight of which are rated ‘high’ severity.

It could allow local privilege-escalation as well as remote compromise of a computer running the app when Windows file sharing (SMB) is enabled, according to the Citrix advisory.The bug, though mostly fixed over the summer, was recently found to still allow attackers to abuse Citrix-signed MSI installers, according to Pen Test Partners (MSI is the filename extension of Windows Installer packages). This turns the bug into a remote command-line injection vulnerability.The update service originally relied on a faulty file hash within a JSON payload to determine if an update should proceed or not – allowing attackers to download their own code by exploiting the weak hash. To fix the problem, the latest update catalogs are now directly downloaded from the Citrix update servers, and the service “cross-references the hashes with the file that is requested for install from the UpdateFilePath attribute,” wrote researchers at Pen Test Partners, in a Monday posting.“If the update file is signed, valid and the hash of the update file matches one of the files within the manifest, the update file is executed to perform the upgrade,” they explained.However, the patch didn’t prevent remote connectivity to limit the attack surface.“The catalog includes executables and MSI files for installation,” according to the firm. “MSI files on the other hand cannot be executed in the same way as executable files, therefore the update service must handle these differently.”In looking at the installer-launch code, the researchers found that the application checks the extension of the file requested for update, and if it ends with MSI, it is assumed to be a Windows Installer file. Since the MSI file is checked for a valid signature and is cross-referenced with the current catalog, attackers can’t directly install arbitrary MSI files.Even though the MSI files are signed and hashed to prevent modification, one of the features supported by the Windows Installer is MSI Transforms (MST).“As the name suggests, MSI Transforms support altering or transforming the MSI database in some way prior to installation,” according to Pen Test Partners. “Domain administrators commonly use this feature to push out MSI files within Active Directory environments that do not always work in an unattended way when executed on their own. For example, an MST might be created that will inject a product activation code prior to installing.”To apply an MST, users would specify the path to the transform file on the command line, which merges the main MSI file with changes that are present within the MST file during the installation process.Therein lies the bug: “Since we can control the arguments passed to msiexec, we can include the path to a malicious Transform but using an official, signed Citrix MSI that is present within the catalog file,” researchers said.Malicious Transforms can be generated with an existing tool called Microsoft Orca, they added, or with a custom tool. Then, to exploit the vulnerability, attackers would place the original MSI installer and the MST onto a network share ready for the victim machine.“Both the local and remote privilege-escalation methods can only be exploited while an instance of CitrixReceiverUpdate.exe is running on the victim host as before,” the researchers concluded. “I think the remote vector is easier to exploit this time around since you can place both MSI and MST files on a network share under the attacker’s control.”Citrix Workspace for Windows users should update their apps to the latest version, containing a revised patch.Share this article:Security researchers and U.S. government authorities alike are urging admins to address Microsoft’s critical privilege escalation flaw.A low-privileged process on a vulnerable machine could allow data harvesting and DoS.Citrix said that it anticipates malicious actors “will move quickly to exploit” two critical flaws in its mobile device management software.

It also uses tricky spear-phishing emails that utilize constantly evolving lures — from false coronavirus pandemic recommendations to fake requests for media interviews. And, the Russian-speaking cybercriminal group targets other Russian organizations, which researchers say is a big no-no within the Russian hacker community.Researchers first discovered the group in August, when it targeted a large, unnamed medical company with a spear-phishing email purporting to be sent by the media holding company RBC. Instead, the email was an attack vector for OldGremlin to encrypt the company’s entire corporate network and demand a $50,000 ransom.“According to Group-IB expert estimations, since the spring, OldGremlin has conducted at least seven phishing campaigns,” said researchers with Group-IB in a Wednesday post. “The hackers have impersonated the self-regulatory organization Mikrofinansirovaniye i Razvitiye (SRO MiR); a Russian metallurgical holding company; the Belarusian plant Minsk Tractor Works; a dental clinic; and the media holding company RBC.”The attack against the medical company is what put OldGremlin on researchers’ radar. In that case, the threat group sent targets a spear-phishing email with an attached ZIP archive, with the subject “Bill due” and purporting to be the finance department of RBC. Once the victim clicked on the .ZIP archive, a unique custom malware called TinyNode was used. TinyNode is a backdoor that downloads and launches additional malware.“After the executable file was run for just 20 seconds, Windows Defender detected and deleted the malware,” said researchers. “Yet these 20 seconds were enough for the trojan to achieve persistence in the infected system. The victim failed to notice anything.”After gaining remote access to the victim’s computer, the threat actors performed network reconnaissance, collected valuable data and propagated across the network, also utilizing the Cobalt Strike framework to make sure that any post-exploitation activity was as effective as possible.“After the attackers conducted reconnaissance and made sure that they were in the domain that interested them, they continued to move laterally across the network, eventually obtaining domain administrator credentials,” said researchers. “They even created an additional account with the same privileges in case the main one was blocked.”A few weeks after the initial attack, OldGremlin then wiped the organization’s backups, spreading TinyCryptor across hundreds of computers on the corporate network, with a ransom note demanding $50,000 in cryptocurrency in exchange for a decryption key.Researchers said that OldGremlin’s first activities began between late March and early April. The group took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic in early lures (a common theme for ransomware strains during this time period, as seen with the [F]Unicorn ransomware), sending financial institutions purported recommendations on how to organize a safe working environment during the pandemic, and impersonating the self-regulatory organization Mikrofinansirovaniye i Razvitiye (SRO MiR).But OldGremlin has also constantly switched up its spear-phishing lures over time to mimic various organizations — from a Russian dental clinic to the Russian microfinance organization Edinstvo. The group has also commonly mimicked RBC in several campaigns. One spear-phishing email, for instance, purported to be sent by a Russian RBC journalist, who invited targets to take part in the “Nationwide survey of the banking and financial sectors during the coronavirus pandemic.” In later email exchanges, the attackers asked victims to click on a link, which then resulted in a custom trojan developed by the cybercriminals, TinyPosh, being downloaded to the victim’s computer.Timeline of OldGremlin’s ransomware attacks. Credit: Group-IBMore recently, the group ramped up its activities in August after a short hiatus on August 13 and 14, sending around 250 malicious emails targeting Russian companies in the financial and industrial sectors. These campaigns also mimicked a journalist with the RBC group and a nickel-producing company.Of note, OldGremlin appears to be made up of Russian speakers and yet is actively targeting Russian companies – which researchers said is a big transgression among the Russian underground.“OldGremlin is the only Russian-speaking ransomware operator that violates the unspoken rule about not working within Russia and post-Soviet countries,” said Oleg Skulkin, senior digital forensics analyst at Group-IB. “They carry out multistage targeted attacks on Russian companies and banks using sophisticated tactics and techniques similar to those employed by APT groups.”Share this article:A new ‘fork’ of the Cerberus banking trojan, called Alien, targets victims’ credentials from more than 200 mobile apps, including Bank of America and Microsoft Outlook.The trojan has seen a big spike in activity since August, the Feds are warning.When it comes to endpoint security, a handful of threats make up the bulk of the most serious attack tools and tactics.

Microsoft has updated its Security Update Guide, which is used by tens of millions of cybersecurity professionals the second Tuesday of every month, also known as Patch Tuesday. The update, according to Microsoft, is meant to deliver a more intuitive user experience.For its latest update, introduced three weeks ahead of its Oct. 13 Patch Tuesday, Microsoft is boasting an improved user experience and a more modern user interfaces, better filtering and customization options for data views, and improved support for multiple languages.The update is “to help protect our customers regardless of what Microsoft products or services they use in their environment,” according to a Microsoft Security Response Center blog post on Tuesday.My team launched a thing today, proud of them! Our new and improved Security Update Guide is a major step forward for MSRC UX and dramatic improvement for our customers to more easily consume Microsoft security patch information. Check it out => https://t.co/bmfQ5KHQAg https://t.co/C2mrHwx9xu— Matthew Dressman (@mdressman) September 22, 2020Scott Caveza, research engineering manager at Tenable said the update was a plus. “All of the old functionality is there, and the new UI is more user friendly and intuitive, once you get used to the new format,” he told Threatpost. He added that the updated interface reduced the manual effort necessary to identify which patches apply to their systems. “The best news is that they realize it needs improvement,” said Dustin Childs, communications manager with Zero Day Initiative. “It is nice to be able to select columns to view, but what is still missing is a snapshot overview of risk for a particular release. For example, on Patch Tuesday, my first question is how many of these bugs are under active attack? Which ones are publicly known? Which ones are severe and require special attention? That data is there, but it still takes some digging to get to it. Hopefully Microsoft will continue to improve the processes they use to communicate security patches. With the volume of patches they are releasing this year, they will certainly have ample opportunities to practice,” Childs said.Microsoft has tinkered over the years with the way it delivers security updates to is vast product catalog. For instance, in 2017, Microsoft debuted a new system that introduced API support that would help customers automate some aspects of patching. The efforts have been met with a mix of cheers and jeers.
Other improvements listed by Microsoft in this latest update include:So far, some security professionals have been critical of the way the new Security Update Guide handles exporting data to spreadsheets.The CVE also loses html – see the diff? pic.twitter.com/XBYL0R6Nvs— SBSDiva (@SBSDiva) September 22, 2020But others on Twitter see it as a big improvement.Huge improvement – good job!— Duncan McCormack (@DuncanMcCNZ) September 22, 2020“The ability to group updates by CVE is wonderful,” Caveza said. “A lot of security personnel target vulnerabilities in their patching, and the new Vulnerabilities tab really helps with that. The Deployments section also notes which updates require reboots and if any known issues have been identified, both of which are key details that any system administrator can appreciate. With the new guide, scheduling and planning for deployments may be much easier and more streamlined by having these key details in one place.”(This article was updated 9/22 with quotes from Scott Caveza and Dustin Childs at 2:22 pm ET)Share this article:A Samba patch and a micropatch for end-of-life servers have debuted in the face of the critical vulnerability.Data exposed included search terms, location coordinates, and device information – but no personal data.The deadline looms for U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s emergency directive for federal agencies to patch against the so-called ‘Zerologon’ vulnerability.Notify me when new comments are added.

Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) is a Firefox version that’s based on an official release for desktop, for use by organizations who need extended support for mass deployments.“Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption, and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code,” according to a Mozilla Foundation security advisory, released on Tuesday.Details are scant regarding where specifically these two high-severity flaws exist and how difficult they are in terms of exploitability; however, Mozilla classifies high-severity flaws as issues “that can be used to gather sensitive data from sites in other windows or inject data or code into those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.”Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer (CVE-2020-15673) and Byron Campen and Christian Holler (CVE-2020-15674) were credited with reporting the flaws.The release of Firefox 81 also fixed a third and final high-severity flaw in its implementation of Web Graphics Library (WebGL), a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser.This bug (CVE-2020-15675) is a use-after-free issue, which is a type of vulnerability related to the incorrect use of dynamic memory. If after freeing a memory location, a program does not clear the pointer to that memory, an attacker can use the error to hack the program. In Firefox’s case, when processing surfaces for WebGL, the lifetime may outlive a persistent buffer leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.Brian Carpenter (via the ASAN Nightly project), who was credited with reporting the flaw, told Threatpost via email that it was introduced during a recent re-factoring of WebGL code.“It would be hard but not impossible to exploit,” he told Threatpost. “An attacker would need to construct a situation that replaced the persistent buffer memory with something else.”The remainder of flaws fixed in Firefox 81 are moderate in severity. These include a download-origin spoofing flaw (CVE-2020-15677) that could be exploited by an attacker impersonating a site displayed in the download file dialog; a cross-site scripting flaw (CVE-2020-15676) that could allow JavaScript to be executed after pasting attacker controlled data into a content-editable element; and another use-after-free flaw (CVE-2020-15678).Threatpost has reached out to Mozilla for further details on whether any of these flaws were exploited in the wild.On the privacy front, Firefox 81 also now reportedly highlights if an installed extension has control over the “Ask to save logins and passwords for websites” setting. This exists in the browser’s Logins and Passwords function (under about:preferences#privacy).Firefox browser bugs have been in the spotlight lately; recently, for instance, a vulnerability in Firefox for Android was discovered that paves the way for an attackers to launch websites on a victim’s phone, with no user interaction. The attack manifests in the form of a Firefox browser window on the target device suddenly launching, without users’ permission.Earlier this year, Mozilla also patched two Firefox browser zero-day vulnerabilities actively being exploited in the wild. The flaws, both use-after-free bugs, have been part of “targeted attacks in the wild.”Share this article:When it comes to patching critical flaws, industrial firms face various challenges – with some needing to shut down entire factories in order to apply updates.Monday’s CISA advisory is a staunch reminder for federal government and private sector entities to apply patches for flaws in F5 BIG-IP devices, Citrix VPNs, Pulse Secure VPNs and Microsoft Exchange servers.An attacker can execute remote code with no user interaction, thanks to CVE-2020-3495.Notify me when new comments are added.

Exploiting the bug allows an unauthenticated attacker, with network access to a domain controller, to completely compromise all Active Directory identity services, according to Microsoft.“This attack has a huge impact: It basically allows any attacker on the local network (such as a malicious insider or someone who simply plugged in a device to an on-premise network port) to completely compromise the Windows domain,” said researchers with Secura, in a whitepaper published earlier this month.As previous reported, the flaw stems from the Netlogon Remote Protocol, available on Windows domain controllers, which is used for various tasks related to user and machine authentication.“The issue exists in the usage of AES-CFB8 encryption for Netlogon sessions. The AES-CFB8 standard requires that each ‘byte’ of plaintext have a randomized initialization vector (IV), blocking attackers from guessing passwords. However, Netlogon’s ComputeNetlogonCredential function sets the IV to a fixed 16 bits – not randomized –  meaning an attacker could control the deciphered text,” according to earlier reporting.Since the flaw was first identified it has been under active attack. Calls for immediate patching have been unanimous. However, the Monday deadline for patching by CISA suggests still too many systems have not been updated.“This emergency directive remains in effect until all agencies have applied the August 2020 Security Update (or other superseding updates) or the directive is terminated through other appropriate action,” according to CISA.The directive is part of the Department of Homeland Security’s “Section 3553(h) of title 44” U.S. Code of Laws.The directive requires security teams at those affected federal civilian and executive branch departments to update all Windows Servers with the domain controller role by midnight EDT Sept. 21. “If affected domain controllers cannot be updated, ensure they are removed from the network,” the agency said.Next, agencies must ensure “technical and/or management controls are in place to ensure newly provisioned or previously disconnected domain controller servers are updated before connecting to agency networks,” CISA wrote.“The availability of the exploit code in the wild increasing likelihood of any upatched domain controller being exploited,” the agency said. It added the widespread presence of the vulnerable domain controllers across the federal enterprise is a concern, coupled with the high potential for agency information systems to be compromised.The CISA directive orders those agencies, by 11:59 PM EDT, Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2020, to submit a “completion report” to DHS.“Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, the CISA Director will engage the CIOs and/or Senior Agency Officials for Risk Management of agencies that have not completed required actions, as appropriate and based on a risk-based approach,” read the CISA directive signed by Christopher Krebs, Director, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, within the Department of Homeland Security.Share this article:A Samba patch and a micropatch for end-of-life servers have debuted in the face of the critical vulnerability.Microsoft announced a new Security Guide to help cybersecurity professionals more quickly untangle relevant bugs in its monthly security bulletins.

The attack manifests in the form of a Firefox browser window on the target device suddenly launching, without the users’ permission. This can be used for various malicious attacks, or as the researcher points out, surprising victims with an auto-playing Rick Astley video.To exploit the bug, an attacker would need to be attached to the same Wi-Fi network as the target, according to researcher Chris Moberly, who recently published details on the bug, along with a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit.“The target simply has to have the Firefox application running on their phone,” he explained. “They do not need to access any malicious websites or click any malicious links. No attacker-in-the-middle or malicious app installation is required. They can simply be sipping coffee while on a cafe’s Wi-Fi, and their device will start launching application URIs under the attacker’s control.”The flaw exists in Firefox for Android’s Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) engine (68.11.0 and below). The SSDP is a network protocol that’s used for the advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information.In this case, the SSDP engine can be tricked into triggering what are called Android intent Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). An “intent” is an abstract description of an operation to be performed. An intent allows developers to specify actions that can start an activity in another app (such as “view a map” or “take a picture”).“The vulnerable Firefox version periodically sends out SSDP discovery messages, looking for second-screen devices to cast to (such as the Roku),” Moberly explained. “These messages are sent via UDP multicast to 239.255.255.250, meaning any device on the same network can see them. Any device on the local network can respond to these broadcasts.”A malicious attacker can respond to one of the “ready to cast” messages and provide the device running Firefox with a location to cast to, he said. Firefox will then attempt to access that location, expecting to find an XML file conforming to universal plug-and-play (UPnP) specifications.“This is where the vulnerability comes in,” Moberly wrote. “Instead of providing the location of an XML file describing a UPnP device, an attacker can run a malicious SSDP server that responds with a specially crafted message pointing to an Android intent URI. Then, that intent will be invoked by the Firefox application itself.”Thus, a specially crafted response can force an Android phone on the local network with Firefox running to suddenly launch a specific website. It can also be used to do this on all Android phones on a network.“This most definitely could have been an epic rick-roll, where everyone in the room running Firefox tried to figure out what the heck was going on,” the researcher said.More malicious attacks could include launching a phishing page, or launching a direct link to an .XPI file, prompting for immediate installation of a malicious extension to compromise the browser itself. The bug could also be used to prompt someone to install a malicious package.Moberly also found that other intents beyond launching a web browser can be invoked, too.“Another example is to call other applications,” he said: In his PoC, he was able to start a mail application with arbitrary text. “Pretty scary to have happen on your device when you’re just minding your own business….However, that execution is not totally arbitrary in that it can only call predefined application intents,” he said.The bug — and the exploit — was afformed by fellow researcher Lucas Stefanko:Exploitation of LAN vulnerability found in Firefox for AndroidI tested this PoC exploit on 3 devices on same wifi, it worked pretty well.I was able to open custom URL on every smartphone using vulnerable Firefox (68.11.0 and below) found by @init_string https://t.co/c7EbEaZ6Yx pic.twitter.com/lbQA4qPehq— Lukas Stefanko (@LukasStefanko) September 18, 2020Firefox quickly fixed the bug, so users should update their application to version 79 or above (this may have already automatically been done). People can verify that they’re up-to-date by navigating to “Settings -> About Firefox” and looking for the version number.  Share this article:Patches and workaround fixes address flaws on networking hardware running Cisco IOS XE software.Convincing SMS messages tell victims that they’ve been selected for a pre-release trial for the soon-to-be-launched device.A new ‘fork’ of the Cerberus banking trojan, called Alien, targets victims’ credentials from more than 200 mobile apps, including Bank of America and Microsoft Outlook.

A new Android malware strain has been uncovered, part of the Rampant Kitten threat group’s widespread surveillance campaign that targets Telegram credentials and more.Researchers have uncovered a threat group launching surveillance campaigns that target victims’ personal device data, browser credentials and Telegram messaging application files. One notable tool in the group’s arsenal is an Android malware that collects all two-factor authentication (2FA) security codes sent to devices, sniffs out Telegram credentials and launches Google account phishing attacks.Researchers found the threat group, dubbed Rampant Kitten, has targeted Iranian entities with surveillance campaigns for at least six years. It specifically targets Iranian minorities and anti-regime organizations, including the Association of Families of Camp Ashraf and Liberty Residents (AFALR); and the Azerbaijan National Resistance Organization.The threat group has relied on a wide array of tools for carrying out their attacks, including four Windows info-stealer variants used for pilfering Telegram and KeePass account information; phishing pages that impersonate Telegram to steal passwords; and the aforementioned Android backdoor that extracts 2FA codes from SMS messages and records the phone’s voice surroundings.“Following the tracks of this attack revealed a large-scale operation that has largely managed to remain under the radar for at least six years,” said researchers with Check Point Research, in a Friday analysis. “According to the evidence we gathered, the threat actors, who appear to be operating from Iran, take advantage of multiple attack vectors to spy on their victims, attacking victims’ personal computers and mobile devices.”Researchers first discovered Rampant Kitten’s campaign through a document, the title of which translates to “The Regime Fears the Spread of the Revolutionary Cannons.docx.” It’s unclear how this document is spread (via spear phishing or otherwise), but it purports to describe the ongoing struggle between the Iranian regime and the Revolutionary Cannons, an anti-regime, Mujahedin-e Khalq movement.The document when opened loads a document template from a remote server (afalr-sharepoint[.]com), which impersonates a website for a non-profit that aids Iranian dissidents.The attack vector. Credit: Check Point ResearchIt then downloads malicious macro code, which executes a batch script to download and execute a next-stage payload. This payload then checks if the popular Telegram messenger service is installed on the victims’ system. If so, it extracts three executables from its resources.These executables include an information stealer, which lifts Telegram files from victim’s computer, steals information from the KeePass password-management application, uploads any file it can find which ends with a set of pre-defined extensions, and logs clipboard data and takes desktop screenshots.Researchers were able to track multiple variants of this payload dating back to 2014. These include the TelB (used in June and July 2020) and TelAndExt variants (May 2019 to February 2020), which focus on Telegram; a Python infostealer (February 2018 to January 2020) that is focused on stealing data from Telegram, Chrome, Firefox and Edge; and a HookInjEx variant (December 2014 to May 2020), an infostealer that targets browsers, device audio, keylogging and clipboard data.During their investigation, researchers also uncovered a malicious Android application tied to the same threat actors. The application was purporting to be a service to help Persian speakers in Sweden get their driver’s license.Instead, once victims download the application, the backdoor steals their SMS messages and bypasses 2FA by forwarding all SMS messages containing 2FA codes to an attacker-controlled phone number.“One of the unique functionalities in this malicious application is forwarding any SMS starting with the prefix G- (The prefix of Google two-factor authentication codes) to a phone number that it receives from the C2 server,” said researchers. “Furthermore, all incoming SMS messages from Telegram, and other social network apps, are also automatically sent to the attackers’ phone number.”Of note, the application also launches a phishing attack targeting victims’ Google account (Gmail) credentials. The user is presented with a legitimate Google login page, inside Android’s WebView. In reality, attackers have used Android’s JavascriptInterface to steal typed-in credentials, as well as a timer which periodically retrieves the information from the username and password input fields.Telegram phishing pages. Credit: Check Point ResearchIt also retrieves personal data (like contacts and account details) and records the phone’s surroundings.“We have located two different variants of the same application, one which appears to be compiled for testing purposes, and the other is the release version, to be deployed on a target’s device,” said researchers.Researchers also warned of websites owned by the threat actors that were phishing pages impersonating Telegram. A Telegram bot was sending phishing messages warning recipients that they were making improper use of Telegram’s services, and that their account will be blocked if they do not enter the phishing link.“Since most of the targets we identified are Iranians, it appears that similarly to other attacks attributed to the Islamic Republic, this might be yet another case in which Iranian threat actors are collecting intelligence on potential opponents to the regime,” said researchers.Share this article:A new ‘fork’ of the Cerberus banking trojan, called Alien, targets victims’ credentials from more than 200 mobile apps, including Bank of America and Microsoft Outlook.Credential abuse drives illicit market for in-game rare skins, special weapons and unique tools.
